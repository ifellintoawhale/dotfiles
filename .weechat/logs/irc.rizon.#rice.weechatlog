2017-03-26 16:55:50	+eti	but are your movements that bad ? just strafing man
2017-03-26 16:55:56	+PikaDrew	It's all about that conservation of momentum
2017-03-26 16:55:58	+PikaDrew	Or well

2017-03-26 16:56:06	+eti	i prefer bhop to be honest
2017-03-26 16:56:11	+PikaDrew	I can't bhop so well

2017-03-26 16:58:11	+PikaDrew	Wait cs doesn't allow you to bhop at 1.5k km/h?
2017-03-26 16:58:13	+PikaDrew	That's lame
2017-03-26 16:58:39	+cosarara	can't do this one though https://youtu.be/5voTzKQGCEg?t=50

2017-03-26 16:59:08	+eti	PikaDrew: it's fine, servers that are made for bhop let you go fast, it's just on official servs
2017-03-26 16:59:14	+PikaDrew	Ah
2017-03-26 16:59:17	+eti	i don't really mind it honestly
2017-03-26 16:59:35	+PikaDrew	Ya see xonotic lets you move quickly anyway. There are servers which boost it even more but still
2017-03-26 16:59:57	+eti	cosarara: yeah that boost is pretty tuff, never got around to do it but i think with training i could manage to
2017-03-26 17:00:00	+cosarara	in xonotic you can just hold space to bhop right?

2017-03-26 17:00:20	+PikaDrew	Umm... Actually yeah I think you can
2017-03-26 17:00:31	+PikaDrew	Lmao forgot about that
2017-03-26 17:00:34	+eti	i prefer the "real" way
2017-03-26 17:00:42	+cosarara	with a scrollwheel
2017-03-26 17:00:44	+PikaDrew	Yes, use a mousewheel instead of a script
2017-03-26 17:00:49	+eti	scroll wheel or whatever you guys prefer
2017-03-26 17:00:50	+eti	yeah
2017-03-26 17:00:51	+PikaDrew	Which has soooo many differences
2017-03-26 17:00:57	+PikaDrew	:P
2017-03-26 17:01:03	+eti	yeah scroll wheel is much more efficient for me
2017-03-26 17:01:17	+eti	i hit most of them with it where as with a script i really can't
2017-03-26 17:01:37	+PikaDrew	I find that surprising.
2017-03-26 17:01:45	+PikaDrew	Maybe you need a better script? :/
2017-03-26 17:01:48	+eti	i remember some guy posted 2 years ago a script run by the csgo client that made you bhop
2017-03-26 17:01:49	+PikaDrew	Or refine it
2017-03-26 17:02:05	+eti	so there was no ahk or whatever to interfere
2017-03-26 17:02:23	+eti	PikaDrew: honestly i like the scrollwheel so meh i'm fine :>
2017-03-26 17:02:31	+PikaDrew	Well, it's not so hard. It's essentially this:
2017-03-26 17:03:21	+PikaDrew	alias bhop1 "+space; sleep 1; -space; sleep 1; bhop2"; alias +bhop "alias bhop2 bhop1"; alias -bhop "alias bhop2 null"
2017-03-26 17:03:36	+PikaDrew	Forgot the "; bhop1" bit in +bhop
2017-03-26 17:03:53	+eti	oh really ?
2017-03-26 17:04:02	+PikaDrew	And then bind a key to +bhop
2017-03-26 17:04:04	+eti	and that isn't blocked by the game you think?
2017-03-26 17:04:15	+PikaDrew	On press, it'll run +bhop, on release -bhop
2017-03-26 17:04:19	+PikaDrew	I mean, it works in TF2
2017-03-26 17:04:29	+PikaDrew	Though usually you want to slow it a bit as it won't put all the spaces through
2017-03-26 17:04:33	+eti	my laptop cannot run csgo right now but i find it pretty weird that such thing is allowed
2017-03-26 17:04:36	+PikaDrew	But I blame that on the net connection
2017-03-26 17:04:40	+PikaDrew	It's... Standard keybinds.
2017-03-26 17:04:52	+PikaDrew	Your main issue is if sleep is disabled
2017-03-26 17:04:52	+eti	no i think this isn't allowed in csgo, people wouldn't be using ahk and stuff either..
2017-03-26 17:05:05	+eti	sleep is disabled
2017-03-26 17:05:07	+PikaDrew	If sleep is disabled, the moment you activate it your game will crash
2017-03-26 17:05:08	+eti	i think so

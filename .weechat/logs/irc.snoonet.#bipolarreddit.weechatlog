2017-07-04 20:33:32	Podge	I have been watching the afterprisonshow on youtube a lot the last few days.
2017-07-04 20:33:50	Podge	I feel like I am watching it halfway because its interesting and halfway because the guy who host it is cute.
2017-07-04 20:35:24	Podge	No citrus in the house but I found a can of pineapple chunks. :o so I put it in the freezer for later.

2017-07-05 23:22:28	babyelephants	I'm good. Waiting on dinner to cook
2017-07-05 23:23:58	podge	whats for dinner?
2017-07-05 23:24:29	babyelephants	Roast chicken and scalloped potatoes
2017-07-05 23:24:34	babyelephants	(I didn't make any of this)
2017-07-05 23:24:44	podge	Still sounds good.
2017-07-05 23:24:45	@jfhbrook	blue apron? XD
2017-07-05 23:24:54	@jfhbrook	I guess you kinda made it with blue apron
2017-07-05 23:25:08	@jfhbrook	weird middle ground
2017-07-05 23:25:18	podge	what the fuck is blue apron?
2017-07-05 23:26:00	@jfhbrook	oh jesus podge 
2017-07-05 23:26:09	@jfhbrook	hold on
2017-07-05 23:26:13	@jfhbrook	ok, so
2017-07-05 23:26:33	podge	Yeah I googled it.
2017-07-05 23:26:33	@jfhbrook	blue apron is this thing where you give them money, and they drop a box of ingredients and a recipe at your door
2017-07-05 23:26:41	babyelephants	Naa, just my nice wife
2017-07-05 23:26:46	podge	I am poor, I make meals without someone pre planning it all for me lol.
2017-07-05 23:26:58	@jfhbrook	so like blue apron is basically targeting me
2017-07-05 23:27:23	babyelephants	We used to have a service like that here, but it couldn't stay in business
2017-07-05 23:27:31	@jfhbrook	people that never really learned to cook, are sick of takeout and have the excess wealth to actually make something decent instead of doing ramen + frozen veg
2017-07-05 23:28:12	podge	So basically for people who were too lazy to learn lol.
2017-07-05 23:28:16	@jfhbrook	I mean
2017-07-05 23:28:24	@jfhbrook	so it's not that I was too lazy to learn, per se
2017-07-05 23:28:39	@jfhbrook	I picked up bits and pieces, in college I would actually cook a little
2017-07-05 23:28:42	@jfhbrook	I learned my favorite dishes
2017-07-05 23:28:48	@jfhbrook	like I used to make a mean macaroni and cheese
2017-07-05 23:29:18	meteorliath	lol those boxes are fun
2017-07-05 23:29:23	meteorliath	I'm getting a free one Friday
2017-07-05 23:29:25	meteorliath	from Plated
2017-07-05 23:29:29	@jfhbrook	cooked a ton of rice and roasted poultry, used to do this whole thing where I would buy a whole turkey, roast it, break down the bones and boil those into stock, fry up the livers n' shit
2017-07-05 23:29:49	meteorliath	I think I got a free one from blue apron too and hello fresh
2017-07-05 23:29:52	@jfhbrook	it's more that I lost those skills and never acquired the cookware
2017-07-05 23:29:54	podge	I still do that every now and then D: lol
2017-07-05 23:30:01	 *	meteorliath takes advantage of all the free boxes
2017-07-05 23:30:01	@jfhbrook	so it's been a few years since I've tried to make mac and cheese
2017-07-05 23:30:04	meteorliath	and then I cancel
2017-07-05 23:30:14	@jfhbrook	that's awesome meteorliath 
2017-07-05 23:30:47	meteorliath	I have friends that use it, and if you pay for it, they give you codes for free boxes that you can send out
2017-07-05 23:31:15	@jfhbrook	you ever read the tightwad gazette? idk how applicable it is these days but when I was a kid it was like the bible for frugal living, taking advantage of savings/etc
2017-07-05 23:31:22	meteorliath	I feel like the cost is probably not terrible, I just don't want to
2017-07-05 23:31:24	@jfhbrook	all from a funny, snarky writer
2017-07-05 23:31:58	meteorliath	lol I don't think I did
2017-07-05 23:32:10	meteorliath	I mean I'm not that bad, or bad at all, I just like free stuff
2017-07-05 23:32:12	podge	Whats the drug policy for the meetup?
2017-07-05 23:32:15	@jfhbrook	https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Tightwad-Gazette-Promoting-Alternative/dp/0375752250/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499315526&sr=8-1&keywords=tightwad+gazette
2017-07-05 23:32:31	@jfhbrook	podge: so I'll be up front, I'm not really running the meetup though I may attend
2017-07-05 23:32:50	@jfhbrook	podge: it sounds relatively lax within reason--so possibly alcohol possibly trees, but hopefully moderation
2017-07-05 23:33:13	@jfhbrook	but you'd have to ask softer and kessa
2017-07-05 23:33:18	podge	So acid it is. :o gotcha
2017-07-05 23:33:23	@jfhbrook	criminy
2017-07-05 23:34:34	@jfhbrook	anyway meteorliath ^^ if you like geeking out over this kinda thing, though dated this is pretty good
2017-07-05 23:35:23	@jfhbrook	her last name iirc is said very close to "decision"
2017-07-05 23:36:09	@jfhbrook	my mom geeked out about that kinda thing a lot when I was a kid, which is why I read it
2017-07-05 23:36:13	@jfhbrook	like she had it laying around
2017-07-05 23:36:22	meteorliath	haha added to wishlist
2017-07-05 23:36:27	meteorliath	OMG
2017-07-05 23:36:45	meteorliath	someone in one of my mom groups is a nurse (which isn't really a surprise)
2017-07-05 23:37:02	meteorliath	but a guy came in tonight . . . 2 vibrators up his butt
2017-07-05 23:37:06	meteorliath	FOR 4 DAYS
2017-07-05 23:37:39	@jfhbrook	like
2017-07-05 23:37:42	podge	I mean something stuck up your butt isnt that weird, but like.. why 2 things? was the first one not enough?
2017-07-05 23:37:48	@jfhbrook	he *knew* he had dildos in his butt
2017-07-05 23:37:51	@jfhbrook	multiple dildos
2017-07-05 23:37:57	@jfhbrook	and he sat on it for 2 days
2017-07-05 23:38:06	@jfhbrook	before saying, you know, it'd be kinda dope if I could take a shit
2017-07-05 23:38:20	meteorliath	4 days
2017-07-05 23:38:20	@jfhbrook	to be fair these might be egg vibes
2017-07-05 23:38:21	podge	I bet he was hoping that he would poop them out.
2017-07-05 23:38:22	meteorliath	4
2017-07-05 23:38:26	@jfhbrook	four

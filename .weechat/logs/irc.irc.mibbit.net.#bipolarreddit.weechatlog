2017-03-26 03:36:46	meteorliath	oooh hi babyelephants / jason
2017-03-26 03:36:53	meteorliath	I've never seen that before
2017-03-26 03:37:03	meteorliath	you should go Brinx 
2017-03-26 03:37:08	meteorliath	you can take my place
2017-03-26 03:37:11	Brinx	i
2017-03-26 03:37:14	meteorliath	it's friendly there 
2017-03-26 03:37:17	Brinx	i'm not eating the body though
2017-03-26 03:37:22	babyelephants	hiya
2017-03-26 03:37:27	meteorliath	luckily at mine we don't do communion every week
2017-03-26 03:37:29	Brinx	not into cannibalism 
2017-03-26 03:37:41	meteorliath	I have no idea when they'll do it but probably not tomorrow
2017-03-26 03:37:43	meteorliath	how are you babyelephants 
2017-03-26 03:38:07	babyelephants	i'm good. not sleepy enough yet
2017-03-26 03:38:29	meteorliath	neither are we!
2017-03-26 03:38:43	Brinx	i napped tonight so i'm pretty screwed. :/
2017-03-26 03:39:46	babyelephants	I slept until 1pm :|
2017-03-26 03:40:09	Brinx	but i'm watching spring breakers so not all is bad i suppose lol
2017-03-26 03:40:32	meteorliath	apparently in LA a 3 bed 865 sqft home costs $560k
2017-03-26 03:41:05	babyelephants	Where do you fit 3 bedrooms in 865 sqft?
2017-03-26 03:41:27	Brinx	very carefully
2017-03-26 03:41:32	meteorliath	that's what I wondered
2017-03-26 03:41:54	Brinx	maybe they're rooms with literally just enough space for a bed
2017-03-26 03:42:03	meteorliath	my 2 bedroom is a bit over 1000sqft and not very big
2017-03-26 03:42:13	meteorliath	I mean big enough, but I can't imagine a third bedroom
2017-03-26 03:42:29	meteorliath	and yeah the rooms looked like just enough space for bed
2017-03-26 03:42:46	meteorliath	master was a bit bigger, but that's where they saved space
2017-03-26 03:43:18	meteorliath	I mean I don't hang out in my bedroom so that's fine
2017-03-26 03:43:25	meteorliath	but still, $560k
2017-03-26 03:44:24	babyelephants	Maybe location counts for $400k
2017-03-26 03:44:43	meteorliath	yeah I know
2017-03-26 03:44:49	meteorliath	another reason not to live in cali
2017-03-26 03:44:51	meteorliath	well mostly LA
2017-03-26 03:45:10	babyelephants	Here you pay an extra $200k to live on one side of the river vs the other
2017-03-26 03:45:14	meteorliath	the nicer home was over 1 million
2017-03-26 03:45:27	meteorliath	i'll live on the cheap side of the river please
2017-03-26 03:45:55	meteorliath	although I feel like that's true here too
2017-03-26 03:46:06	babyelephants	yep. i do 
2017-03-26 03:46:08	meteorliath	there's a fancy side of the river and then less fancy, but still kind of fancy
2017-03-26 03:47:08	meteorliath	ooh I found my whiskey
2017-03-26 03:47:11	meteorliath	I mean I forgot I lost it
2017-03-26 03:47:14	meteorliath	but I found it
2017-03-26 03:47:22	meteorliath	that's the important part here
2017-03-26 03:50:05	meteorliath	fuck me, I have to call my psych on Monday
2017-03-26 03:50:22	Brinx	i'm hoping to get psych calls on monday :/
2017-03-26 03:50:33	babyelephants	I'm going to try sleeping again or i'll need to call mine as well!
2017-03-26 03:50:38	meteorliath	haha
2017-03-26 03:50:42	meteorliath	do you have anything for sleep?
2017-03-26 03:50:51	meteorliath	benadryl might help if it's ok to take
2017-03-26 03:51:06	meteorliath	and I saw melatonin gummies at the store the other day
2017-03-26 03:51:09	babyelephants	not any more, but coffee helps which is probably weird
2017-03-26 03:51:15	meteorliath	it's not weird
2017-03-26 03:51:20	meteorliath	coffee doesn't keep me awake either
2017-03-26 03:51:58	meteorliath	I can take quite a few espresso shots and go to bed.  I learned that in college.  It was nice to find it was pointless

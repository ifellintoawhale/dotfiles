2017-03-30 22:05:00	meteorliath	how are you?
2017-03-30 22:05:12	babyelephants	I'm good. Hiding from work 
2017-03-30 22:05:29	meteorliath	sounds like fun
2017-03-30 22:05:44	babyelephants	Eh. It would be more fun with cookies.
2017-03-30 22:06:57	meteorliath	everything is more fun with cookies
2017-03-30 22:07:40	meteorliath	I called my grandpa today, which I do pretty regularly 
2017-03-30 22:07:59	meteorliath	I call both my grandparents 2-4 times a month
2017-03-30 22:08:19	meteorliath	today he thanked me for calling just to call, and he sounded so sad
2017-03-30 22:08:25	meteorliath	I cried
2017-03-30 22:08:30	babyelephants	That sounds nice. I talked to my grandma a few days ago and she told me all about the garden she's planting.
2017-03-30 22:09:10	babyelephants	We're coming up on one year after my grandpa died and it's sort of got her down.
2017-03-30 22:09:15	meteorliath	I want to plant a garden!
2017-03-30 22:09:17	babyelephants	As one would expect.
2017-03-30 22:09:44	meteorliath	yeah my husbands family was the same and 1 year was the hardest
2017-03-30 22:09:45	babyelephants	She's going to have lots of cucumbers which will become pickles.
2017-03-30 22:10:35	babyelephants	We had it bad, my dad and grandfather both in less than a year. And now my wife's grandmother has cancer.
2017-03-30 22:10:53	babyelephants	Gotta be thankful for the times we have!
2017-03-30 22:11:17	meteorliath	yeah
2017-03-30 22:11:23	meteorliath	my husband lost his grandap
2017-03-30 22:11:26	meteorliath	*grandpa
2017-03-30 22:11:35	meteorliath	and then grandma went 1 year and 1 day later
2017-03-30 22:11:44	meteorliath	and then his mom a few years after that
2017-03-30 22:12:21	meteorliath	I haven't lost anyone, but my grandpa is still working, lawn maintenance and my grandma just retired.  We are a young family 
2017-03-30 22:13:16	babyelephants	My wife's parents had her when they were 42-44, so all her relatives are oldddd
2017-03-30 22:13:36	meteorliath	haha my grandma had my mom when she was 19
2017-03-30 22:13:43	meteorliath	my mom had me when she had just turned 20
2017-03-30 22:13:54	babyelephants	There's one uncle who was a pilot in "the war" and still drives himself around at 93

2017-03-30 22:37:42	meteorliath	I think I watched somoene cook that on a show once 
2017-03-30 22:38:33	babyelephants	I really like it. But earlier today, after I'd bought all the ingredients, my wife informed me that after years of me making it regularly, she doesn't actually like very much. So I may be eating it alone. 
2017-03-30 22:38:57	meteorliath	hahaha, I'm sorry <3 
2017-03-30 22:39:10	babyelephants	:P Truth is alway better, right?

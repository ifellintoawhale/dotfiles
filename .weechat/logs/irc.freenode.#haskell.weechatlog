2017-03-26 03:00:38	Vibor	Hi how can I use '.' or '$' to truncate a line like this : DM.appendDB fileName (makeUPTuple (argv !! 1)  (argv !! 2 ++   "\n"))
2017-03-26 03:01:11	Vibor	I meant truncate parenthesis
2017-03-26 03:01:22	dmwit	appendDB file . makeUPTuple (argv !! 1) $ argv !! 2 ++ "\n"

2017-03-26 03:02:11	Vibor	dmwit: and is there a way to deal with parenthesis enclosing argv !! 1 ?

2017-03-26 03:04:37	Vibor	So maybe this question looks stupid, but does it mean it's not always a bad haskell coding style if you have parenthsis around statements cuz cometimes they are just unavoidable?
2017-03-26 03:04:45	Vibor	dmwit: 
2017-03-26 03:05:12	dmwit	Explicit parentheses are often the most readable style.
2017-03-26 03:05:15	MarcelineVQ	tons of people prefer parens over $
2017-03-26 03:06:22	Vibor	MarcelineVQ: really? I saw lots of references recommending getting rid of them for readability
